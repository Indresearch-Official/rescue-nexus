ðŸ§  AI Research Model â€“ Colab Tutorial
Welcome to the official Colab notebook for our AI research model! This guide will walk you through using the notebook step-by-step, from setup to prediction.

Open the Colab Notebook

Step-by-Step Tutorial
1. Download the file given named "Durgapur_Weather_3Years.xlsx"
2. Save it to you google drive under the folder "My Drive"
3. After downloading the file Open the Notebook in Google Colab by [Clicking this link](https://bit.ly/RescueNexusAIModel)
4. Then run the first block of code by clicking the play button on the left hand side and give it access to your google drive.

5. After giving access run the second block of code, this one trains the AI Model based on the data enabling you to run it later.
6. After executing run the third block of code. In this one you will be able to predict the weather.

8. These steps helped you to run the AI Model yourself.

   
To use it as an API Follow the Next Steps
1. Run this block of code and wait as it may take a while.

3. Run the "NORMAL API WITHOUT ESP INTEGRATION"

4. You will see this but REMEMBER THE LINK WILL BE DIFFERENT EVERYTIME YOUR RUN IT. DO NOT STOP/KILL THE PROCESS

6. After getting the link scroll down a bit and COPY THE CODE INTO YOUR OWN PYTHON ENVIRONMENT. THIS WILL NOT WORK THERE AS COLAB DOESN'T SUPPORT EXECUTION OF TWO BLOCKS AT ONCE.

8. Replace the URL with URL you got from Step 4
9. Now after executing, you will the predictions made.


"THE REST OF THE CODES ARE ARDUINO AND ESP ENVIRONMENT CODES"
